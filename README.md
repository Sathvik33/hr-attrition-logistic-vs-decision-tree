Employee Attrition Predictor — Logistic Regression vs Decision Tree 🏢
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company or not) using HR analytics data.
We compare the performance of two classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression — simple, interpretable, and effective for linear problems.

Decision Tree Classifier — handles non-linear relationships and provides decision rule insights.

🎯 Goals
Predict employee attrition using key features like Monthly Income, Age, Job Satisfaction, Years at Company, and Overtime status.

Compare Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier on accuracy and performance.

Derive actionable insights for HR Analytics and Employee Retention strategies.

📂 Dataset Information

Target: Attrition (Yes/No)

🏆 Model Comparison Summary
Model	Accuracy (Example)	Strengths	Limitations
Logistic Regression	~85-88%	Easy to interpret, fast training	Less effective on complex patterns
Decision Tree	~90-93%	Captures non-linearity, easy to visualize	Prone to overfitting without tuning

✅ Conclusion:

Logistic Regression is good for quick interpretability.

Decision Tree performs better in handling complex relationships.
